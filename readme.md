# Calamari.io Clock in/Clock with ESP32

This is an implementation for Arduino IDE for using Calamari.io API with the ESP32 development board.

You need to have a Calamari API key, which only the admin of your Calamari workspace can generate.

Then you'll need to rename `config.h.dist` file to `config.h` and add the right parameter values.
